# Door-unlock-using-Arduino-Uno
A simple project to unlock the door using 4*4 keypad and Arduino. User will input the password,if it matches the door will be unlocked. Otherwise it will not unlock

# How Does the Keyless Door Lock System Work?

Whenever the keys are pressed, they are matched with the keys already stored. If the keys that are pressed match the initial password stored in the EEPROM which is ‘1234’, then the lock will open up. If the password does not match, then it will print “access denied” on the LCD. 
If the ‘#’ key will be pressed, it will ask you to enter the current password and if it matches, then it will ask you to enter the new password and the password will be changed.
